# FiveM Discord Bot
One file python discord bot.<br>
I'll improve and simplify the code so you can see it better.

You can log players without admin panel or authorization. (You can use this Log only if the files are not hidden from server-side!)<br>
You can use race command to calculate post-race fares.<br>
(1st: %60, 2nd: %30, 3rd: %10, but the third player gets the lowest entry fee.)

Important!<br>
You need to create ".env" file to store your discord bot token.<br>
You need to create "resourceslog.txt" and "counter.txt" to make it work.<br>
pip install requests<br>
pip install discord.py
